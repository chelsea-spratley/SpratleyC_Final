				    <p>Capri, an island in Italy’s Bay of Naples, is famed for its rugged landscape, upscale hotels and shopping, from designer fashions to limoncello and handmade leather sandals. One of its best-known natural sites is the Blue Grotto, a dark cavern where the sea glows electric blue, the result of sunlight passing through an underwater cave. In summer, Capri's dramatic, cove-studded coastline draws many yachts.</p>

You’re in Italy, so just enjoy the bread, pizza, pasta, and gelato on repeat. Capri is known for it’s lemons, so be sure to have lots of lemon anything– from pasta to gelato. Also, make sure you have a lot of Caprese salad!</h3>

								    <h4>Spend a day at the picturesque Fontelina Beach Club. They have two reservations available and while their food isn’t said to be the best, you’re going for the experience and the atmosphere. Lounge in a chair under the blue and white striped umbrellas all day and you’ll be in beach club heaven. They only take reservations three days in advance unless you’re reserving for two days.</h4>
								    <h4>Shop. Everyone talked about how Capri has the best shopping! While I thought it was great, I think the beautiful hand made sandals you can find there were my favorite. It’d be fun to splurge on a new pair of sunglasses or a bag there, but the nice shopping seemed comparable to any other nice area. I personally prefer to find unique items to bring back with me or a little something to splurge on to remind me of my trip, rather than buying something I can get any time back home.</h4>

												        The best times to visit Capri are May, September and October. During these months, crowds are much thinner than in the summer and temperatures still hover above 60 degrees. Summer yields fantastic sunbathing and beach opportunities, but ferries packed with daytrippers swarm the island and cause prices to inflate in July and August. You can also find fantastic deals during the winter. But many cafes and restaurants close for the season during that time, though temperatures still remain above 40 degrees.
