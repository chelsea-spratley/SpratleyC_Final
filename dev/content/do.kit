<title>What to Do</title>

    <h4>Spend a day at the picturesque Fontelina Beach Club. They have two reservations available and while their food isn’t said to be the best, you’re going for the experience and the atmosphere. Lounge in a chair under the blue and white striped umbrellas all day and you’ll be in beach club heaven. They only take reservations three days in advance unless you’re reserving for two days.</h4>
    <h4>Shop. Everyone talked about how Capri has the best shopping! While I thought it was great, I think the beautiful hand made sandals you can find there were my favorite. It’d be fun to splurge on a new pair of sunglasses or a bag there, but the nice shopping seemed comparable to any other nice area. I personally prefer to find unique items to bring back with me or a little something to splurge on to remind me of my trip, rather than buying something I can get any time back home.</h4>
