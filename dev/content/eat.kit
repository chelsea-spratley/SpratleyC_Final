        <div class="p1"> <h3>As with so many places in Italy, I don’t think you’ll have a bad meal on Capri. Skip the ones in the marina right by the ferries and you should be good to go. You’re in Italy, so just enjoy the bread, pizza, pasta, and gelato on repeat. Capri is known for it’s lemons, so be sure to have lots of lemon anything– from pasta to gelato. Also, make sure you have a lot of Caprese salad!</h3>
