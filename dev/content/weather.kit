        The best times to visit Capri are May, September and October. During these months, crowds are much thinner than in the summer and temperatures still hover above 60 degrees. Summer yields fantastic sunbathing and beach opportunities, but ferries packed with daytrippers swarm the island and cause prices to inflate in July and August. You can also find fantastic deals during the winter. But many cafes and restaurants close for the season during that time, though temperatures still remain above 40 degrees.
